# Intrusion Detection System (Java-Based) 🔐

This project is a lightweight, rule-based **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** developed in **Java** to monitor network activities and detect unauthorized or suspicious behavior. It aims to strengthen network security by flagging potential threats in real-time using custom logic and pattern recognition.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To provide a foundational IDS that can:
- Analyze network traffic and system events.
- Detect common attack patterns.
- Alert users of any suspicious activities or intrusion attempts.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🚫 Real-time intrusion detection using rule-based logic.
- 📊 Monitors incoming and outgoing traffic patterns.
- 📂 Logs suspicious behavior for audit and review.
- ⚙️ Configurable detection rules for flexibility.
- 🧩 Modular code design for easy scalability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse  
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - File handling and logging
  - Event monitoring and alert systems
  - Rule-based condition matching
